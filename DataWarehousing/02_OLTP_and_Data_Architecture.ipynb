    "## 1. The \"Big Three\" of Data Storage\n",
    "Before understanding transactional systems, we must clarify a common interview question: **What is the difference between a Data Lake, Data Warehouse, and Data Mart?**\n",
    "\n",
    "### A. Data Lake\n",
    "*   **Origin:** Evolved with the rise of Big Data.\n",
    "*   **Content:** Stores **all** types of data:\n",
    "    *   **Structured:** CSV, Relational tables.\n",
    "    *   **Semi-Structured:** JSON, XML, Logs, HTML.\n",
    "    *   **Unstructured:** Images (JPEG), PDFs, Audio files.\n",
    "*   **Purpose:** A vast \"ocean\" or holding area for raw data. It is often cost-effective storage (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage).\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Warehouse (DW)\n",
    "*   **Content:** Stores primarily **Structured** data (sometimes Semi-Structured).\n",
    "*   **Characteristics:**\n",
    "    *   **Cleaned & Aligned:** Data is processed before entry.\n",
    "    *   **Optimized:** Designed for fast reading and analysis.\n",
    "*   **Purpose:** The central \"Source of Truth\" for the entire organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Data Mart\n",
    "*   **Definition:** A subset of a Data Warehouse.\n",
    "*   **Characteristics:** **Subject-Oriented**.\n",
    "*   **Examples:**\n",
    "    *   **Sales Data Mart:** Contains only sales, products, and customer data.\n",
    "    *   **HR Data Mart:** Contains employee, payroll, and absence data.\n",
    "*   **Purpose:** To serve specific business lines without exposing them to the complexity of the entire Warehouse.\n",

    "## 2. OLTP: Online Transaction Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "**OLTP** systems are the operational systems that run the day-to-day business.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Characteristics:\n",
    "1.  **Online & Recent:** Handles current data (e.g., last 6-18 months). Old data is often archived to maintain performance.\n",
    "2.  **Read/Write Intensive:** Supports thousands of concurrent users reading and writing data (e.g., placing orders on Amazon).\n",
    "3.  **Fast Response:** Response times must be in **milliseconds**.\n",
    "4.  **Highly Normalized:**\n",
    "    *   Data is split into many tables to reduce redundancy and ensure consistency (ACID properties).\n",
    "    *   Follows database normalization rules (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF).\n",
    "    *   Heavy use of **Foreign Keys** and relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The \"Amazon Order\" Example\n",
    "When you place a single order on Amazon, the data isn't just dumped into one big row. It is split across multiple tables (Order info, Customer info, Shipping info, Billing info, Order Items).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's simulate an OLTP system using Python and SQLite to see how normalized data looks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simulation: E-Commerce OLTP Database\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import sqlite3\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",

    "conn = sqlite3.connect(':memory:')\n",

    "### Simulating a Transaction (Write Operation)\n",
    "In an OLTP system, a single user action (buying 2 items) triggers inserts into multiple tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# 1. Register a Customer\n",

    "\n",
    "# 3. Customer Places an Order (Transaction Start)\n",
    "# Insert into Order Header\n",
    "cursor.execute(\"INSERT INTO Orders VALUES (5001, 1, '2023-12-01', 'Shipped')\")\n",

    "### The Challenge of OLTP Reporting\n",

    "## 3. Why not use OLTP for Analytics?\n",
    "This brings us to the core problem solved by Data Warehousing.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we tried to run a report: *\"Show me total sales of Red Pens in NY for the last 5 years\"* on this OLTP system:\n",
    "1.  **Performance Hit:** The database has to join millions of rows across 4+ tables. This consumes CPU/Memory, slowing down the website for users trying to place new orders.\n",
    "2.  **Data Availability:** OLTP systems often archive data older than 1-2 years to keep the tables light. Historical data might not even be there.\n",
    "3.  **Complexity:** Business analysts would need to write massive SQL queries with 10+ joins to understand the data model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** We move this data to an **OLAP** (Online Analytical Processing) system—which we will discuss in the next notebook."
