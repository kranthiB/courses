    "# Data Warehousing - Part 5: Measures and Attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. The Building Blocks of Data\n",
    "In a Data Warehouse, every piece of data generally falls into one of two categories:\n",
    "1.  **Measures:** The numbers we want to analyze (Quantitative).\n",
    "2.  **Attributes (Dimensions):** The context for those numbers (Descriptive).\n",
    "\n",
    "### What makes a Measure?\n",
    "A common misconception is that \"any column with numbers is a measure.\" This is **FALSE**.\n",
    "A measure must have a **logical meaning after aggregation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Sales Amount:** If I add Sales from today and yesterday ($100 + $200 = $300), does it make sense? **Yes.** -> **Measure**.\n",
    "*   **Room Number / User ID:** If I add Room 101 and Room 102 (101 + 102 = 203), does it make sense? **No.** -> **Attribute**.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",

    "# Data Sample\n",
    "data = {\n",
    "    'Transaction_ID': [1001, 1002], # Number, but Attribute\n",
    "    'Room_Number': [101, 102],      # Number, but Attribute\n",

    "## 2. Types of Measures\n",
    "Not all measures behave the same way. We categorize them based on how they can be aggregated (Summed) across different dimensions (like Time, Store, Product).\n",
    "\n",
    "### A. Additive Measures\n",
    "These are the easiest to handle. They can be summed across **ALL** dimensions.\n",
    "*   **Example:** `Total Sales`.\n",
    "*   You can sum sales across Products, across Stores, and across Dates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Semi-Additive Measures\n",
    "These can be summed across **SOME** dimensions, but usually **NOT across Time (Date)**.\n",
    "*   **Example:** `Inventory Balance` (Stock Quantity).\n",
    "*   *Scenario:*\n",
    "    *   Jan 1st Stock: 50 items.\n",
    "    *   Jan 2nd Stock: 60 items.\n",
    "*   *Logic:*\n",
    "    *   Sum across Stores? Yes. (Store A has 10 + Store B has 20 = Total 30 items today).\n",
    "    *   Sum across Dates? **NO.** (50 items on Jan 1 + 60 items on Jan 2 != 110 items). The stock is a snapshot.\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Non-Additive Measures\n",
    "These cannot be summed across **ANY** dimension.\n",
    "*   **Example:** `Profit Margin %`, `Temperature`, `Unit Price`.\n",
    "*   *Logic:*\n",
    "    *   Product A Margin: 10%\n",
    "    *   Product B Margin: 20%\n",
    "    *   Total Margin is **NOT** 30%. You must recalculate the margin based on total Cost and Revenue.\n",
