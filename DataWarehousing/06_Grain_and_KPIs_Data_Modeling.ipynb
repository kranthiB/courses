    "# Data Warehousing - Part 6: Grain, KPIs, and Data Modeling Fundamentals\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. The Most Important Concept: Grain\n",
    "If you get the \"Grain\" wrong, your entire Data Warehouse is useless.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:** The Grain is the **level of detail** (or measurement) of a single row in a Fact table.\n",
    "It answers the question: *\"What does one row in this table represent?\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Grains in Retail\n",
    "1.  **Lowest Grain (Atomic):** One row = One specific item in a specific transaction.\n",
    "    *   *Example:* Order #1001, Item: Red Pen.\n",
    "2.  **Aggregated Grain (Daily):** One row = Total sales of a Product per Day per Store.\n",
    "    *   *Example:* Jan 1st, NY Store, Red Pens sold: 50.\n",
    "3.  **Highly Aggregated Grain (Monthly):** One row = Total sales of a Store per Month.\n",
    "    *   *Example:* Jan 2023, NY Store, Total Sales: $5000.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is Grain Important?\n",
    "*   **Flexibility:** Lower grain (more detail) allows you to answer more questions. If you store data at a \"Monthly\" grain, you **cannot** answer \"What happened on Jan 15th?\".\n",
    "*   **Storage:** Lower grain requires more storage space.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python Simulation: Determining Grain\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",
    "# Scenario: We have raw transaction data\n",
    "raw_data = {\n",
    "    'Date': ['2023-01-01', '2023-01-01', '2023-01-01'],\n",
    "    'Store': ['NY', 'NY', 'NY'],\n",
    "    'Product': ['Pen', 'Pencil', 'Pen'],\n",
    "    'Qty': [1, 2, 5]\n",
    "}\n",
    "df_raw = pd.DataFrame(raw_data)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"--- Atomic Grain (Transaction Level) ---\")\n",
    "# Grain: Per Transaction, Per Product\n",
    "display(df_raw)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"\\n--- Daily Store Grain (Aggregated) ---\")\n",
    "# Grain: Per Date, Per Store (Product detail is lost!)\n",
    "df_daily_grain = df_raw.groupby(['Date', 'Store'])['Qty'].sum().reset_index()\n",
    "display(df_daily_grain)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "*Key Takeaway: You can always roll up (aggregate) from a lower grain to a higher grain, but you cannot drill down if you only store the high-level aggregate.*\n",

    "## 2. KPI: Key Performance Indicators\n",
    "\n",
    "**KPIs** are the *measurable values* that demonstrate how effectively a company is achieving its key business objectives. The entire purpose of building a Data Warehouse is to calculate and track these KPIs accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Relationship: KPI -> Requirement -> Grain\n",
    "1.  **KPI (The Business Need):** \"We need to track 'Daily Sales Growth per Store'.\"\n",
    "2.  **Requirement:** We need sales data.\n",
    "3.  **Grain Decision:** To track \"Daily\" growth, our Fact table **must** have a grain of at least \"Day\". We cannot store data at a \"Month\" grain.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples of KPIs\n",
    "*   **Revenue:** Total Sales Amount.\n",
    "*   **Profit Margin:** (Revenue - Cost) / Revenue.\n",
    "*   **Customer Retention Rate:** % of customers who return.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Fact Tables\n",
    "*   **Content:** Contains **Measures** (Numbers) and Foreign Keys.\n",
