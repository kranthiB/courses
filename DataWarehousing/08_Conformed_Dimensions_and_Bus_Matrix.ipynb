    "In the previous demo, we built a Star Schema for **Sales (Orders)**. But a real company doesn't just sell things; it also manages inventory, pays employees, and buys from vendors.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we build a separate Data Warehouse for Sales and a completely separate one for Inventory, we create **Data Silos**.\n",
    "*   *Sales Team says:* \"We sold 50 units of Product X.\"\n",
    "*   *Inventory Team says:* \"We don't have 'Product X', we call it 'Item X-Ray'.\"\n",
    "*   **Result:** You cannot compare Sales vs. Inventory because the \"Product\" definition doesn't match."

    "## 2. The Solution: Conformed Dimensions\n",
    "A **Conformed Dimension** is a dimension that has the **same meaning and content** when referred to by different Fact tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Write Once, Read Everywhere:** You create the `Product Dimension` table **once**.\n",
    "*   **Link Multiple Facts:** Both the `Sales_Fact` and `Inventory_Fact` tables point to this same `Product Dimension`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transcript Scenario\n",
    "The transcript describes two processes:\n",
    "1.  **Order Fact (Sales)**\n",
    "2.  **Inventory Fact**\n",
    "\n",
    "They share common dimensions: **Product, Staff, Time, Location**.\n",
    "They have specific dimensions: **Customer** (Sales only), **Vendor** (Inventory only).\n",
