    "## 1. What is SCD Type 1?\n",
    "**Slowly Changing Dimension Type 1 (SCD 1)** is a method used to handle changes in dimension tables where **history is NOT preserved**.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Behavior:** If a record changes in the source, we simply **overwrite** the existing record in the Data Warehouse.\n",
    "*   **Result:** The Data Warehouse always reflects the **current state** of the world. We lose knowledge of what the data looked like in the past.\n",
    "*   **Use Case:** Correcting data errors (e.g., spelling mistakes in names) or when history is irrelevant (e.g., \"Current Marital Status\" might not need tracking for some businesses).\n",

    "## 2. Key Concepts: Surrogate Keys vs. Natural Keys\n",
    "Before implementing SCD, we must distinguish between two types of keys:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Natural Key (Business Key):** The unique ID from the source system (e.g., `Employee_ID: E001`). This is how the business identifies the entity.\n",
    "2.  **Surrogate Key:** An artificial, auto-incrementing integer created within the Data Warehouse (e.g., `Employee_Key: 1`).\n",
    "    *   *Why?* It decouples the DW from the source system, improves join performance (integers are faster than strings), and allows handling history (in SCD Type 2, one Natural Key can have multiple Surrogate Keys).\n",
