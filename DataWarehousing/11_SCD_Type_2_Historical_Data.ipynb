    "## 1. What is SCD Type 2?\n",
    "**SCD Type 2** is the most common technique for preserving history in a Data Warehouse. Unlike SCD 1 (which overwrites), SCD 2 **adds a new row** for every change.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Behavior:** When a record changes in the source, the old record in the DW is marked as \"expired,\" and a new record is inserted as \"active.\"\n",
    "*   **Result:** We have a full history of changes over time.\n",
    "*   **Key Columns Required:**\n",
    "    1.  **Surrogate Key:** Unique ID for every row (version) in the dimension.\n",
    "    2.  **Natural Key:** The business ID (e.g., Employee ID) linking all versions.\n",
    "    3.  **Effective Start Date:** When this version became active.\n",
    "    4.  **Effective End Date:** When this version expired (Active records usually have a future date like `9999-12-31`).\n",
    "    5.  **Active Flag:** (Optional but recommended) 'Y' for current, 'N' for history.\n",
