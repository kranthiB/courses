    "Fact tables are the heart of the Star Schema. They store the **Measures** (numbers) and foreign keys to Dimensions.\n",
    "There are three main types of Fact Tables:\n",
    "1.  **Transactional Fact Table:** Records every single event/transaction.\n",
    "2.  **Periodic Snapshot Fact Table (Aggregated):** Records the state of things at a regular interval (e.g., Daily Stock Level).\n",
    "3.  **Accumulating Snapshot Fact Table:** Records the milestones of a process (e.g., Order Placed -> Shipped -> Delivered).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this session, we will focus on **Transactional** and **Periodic Snapshot (Aggregated)** facts.\n",
