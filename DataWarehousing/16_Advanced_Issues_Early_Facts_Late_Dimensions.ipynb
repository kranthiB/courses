    "In a perfect world, Dimension data (like Products) always arrives before Transaction data (like Orders).\n",
    "*   *Ideal:* Product 'P-100' is created in the system at 9:00 AM. Order for 'P-100' comes at 10:00 AM. The ETL joins them perfectly.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the real world, systems are asynchronous or buggy.\n",
    "*   *Reality:* Order for 'P-100' arrives at 10:00 AM. The Product system is slow and sends the 'P-100' details at 11:00 AM.\n",
    "*   **Result:** When the Order loads, the join to `Dim_Product` fails because 'P-100' doesn't exist yet. This is called an **Early Arriving Fact** or a **Late Arriving Dimension**.\n",
