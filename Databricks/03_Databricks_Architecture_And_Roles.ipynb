    "# Databricks Architecture & Roles\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** Understand the high-level architecture of Databricks, specifically how it integrates with cloud providers (Azure/AWS/GCP), the separation of responsibilities (Control Plane vs. Data Plane), and the administrative roles required to manage the platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Cloud Account & Workspace Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Databricks operates on top of major cloud providers: **AWS, Azure, and GCP**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Hierarchy\n",
    "1.  **Databricks Account:** The top-level entity. You can have one Databricks Account managing multiple Workspaces.\n",
    "2.  **Workspaces:** Isolated environments for different teams or stages (e.g., `Dev`, `UAT`, `Prod`).\n",
    "    *   All workspaces are managed by the same Account.\n",
    "    *   Users and Groups are often defined at the Account level and assigned to specific Workspaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Workspace URL Anatomy\n",
    "When you launch a workspace, you will see a URL structure similar to this:\n",
    "*   `https://adb-<workspace-id>.<region>.azuredatabricks.net`\n",
    "*   `https://<workspace-id>.cloud.databricks.com`\n",
    "\n",
    " The unique number in the URL is the **Workspace ID**."

    "*   **Tasks:**\n",
    "    *   Create new Workspaces (e.g., Setup Dev, QA, Prod).\n",

    "*   **Scope:** Unity Catalog (Data Governance).\n",
    "*   **Tasks:**\n",
    "    *   Create **Catalogs**.\n",
    "    *   Manage data objects (Schemas, Tables).\n",
    "    *   Delegate privileges/permissions to other users/groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Workspace Administrator\n",
    "*   **Scope:** A specific Workspace (e.g., the Admin of just the 'Dev' environment).\n",
    "*   **Tasks:**\n",
    "    *   Manage Workspace-level users and groups.\n",
    "    *   Manage Workspace assets (Cluster policies, Folders).\n",
    "    *   Grant permissions within that specific workspace.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Owner\n",
    "*   **Scope:** Specific Objects.\n",
    "*   **Definition:** The user who creates an object is the **Owner**.\n",
    "*   **Example:** If you create a Table or a Schema, you are the Owner. You have full control over it and can grant access to others."
