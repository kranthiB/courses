    "# How Databricks Works Internally with Azure\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** Understand what actually happens in the background when you create a Databricks Workspace and spin up a Cluster. We will explore the \"Managed Resource Group\" in Azure to see the underlying Virtual Machines (VMs), Storage Accounts, and Networking components.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. The \"Managed Resource Group\"\n",
    "\n",
    "When we created our Azure Databricks workspace, we provided two resource groups:\n",
    "1.  **Resource Group:** Where the Databricks Service object lives.\n",
    "2.  **Managed Resource Group:** A restricted group where Databricks deploys the actual compute and storage resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's inside the Managed Resource Group?\n",
    "If you navigate to the **Managed Resource Group** (e.g., `self-adb-managed-rg`) in the Azure Portal, you will find:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Storage Account (DBFS Root):** Stores default data, logs, and libraries.\n",
    "*   **Network Security Group (NSG):** Manages inbound/outbound traffic rules.\n",
    "*   **Virtual Network (VNet):** (If not using VNet injection) Default network for clusters.\n",
    "*   **Disk:** Managed disks for the VMs.\n",
    "*   **Virtual Machines:** (Only when a cluster is running) The actual compute nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Cluster Lifecycle & Azure Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's simulate the lifecycle of a cluster and observe the changes in Azure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A. Cluster Creation (Start)\n",
    "When you click **Start** on a cluster:\n",
    "1.  Databricks Control Plane sends a request to Azure Resource Manager.\n",
    "2.  Azure provisions **Virtual Machines (VMs)** inside the **Managed Resource Group**.\n",
    "3.  Azure allocates **Network Interfaces** and **Public IPs** (if applicable).\n",
    "4.  The Spark Driver and Executors are installed on these VMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Cluster Running\n",
    "*   You will see resources like `Standard_DS3_v2` (Virtual Machine) in the Managed Resource Group.\n",
    "*   **Cost:** You are billed by Azure for these VMs every minute they run.\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Cluster Termination (Stop)\n",
    "When you click **Terminate** (or Auto-Termination kicks in):\n",
    "1.  Databricks sends a de-provisioning request.\n",
    "2.  Azure **deletes** the Virtual Machines.\n",
    "3.  Azure **releases** the Public IPs and Network Interfaces.\n",
    "4.  **Cost:** Billing for the VMs stops immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: The Storage Account and Network Security Group persist even when clusters are off.*"

    "## 3. Storage Account Deep Dive (DBFS)\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside the Managed Resource Group, there is a Storage Account (randomly named, e.g., `dbstorage...`). This is the **DBFS Root** (Databricks File System).\n",
    "\n",
    "It contains containers like:\n",
    "*   `access-logs`: Audit logs.\n",
    "*   `libraries`: Python/Jar libraries installed on clusters.\n",
    "*   `root`: The default location for `dbfs:/`.\n",

    "## 4. Key Takeaways regarding Cost\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Azure Billing:** You pay for the VMs, Disks, and Networking in the Managed Resource Group.\n",
    "2.  **Databricks Billing:** You pay for DBUs (Databricks Units) based on the workload type (Jobs vs. All-Purpose Compute).\n",
    "3.  **Optimization:** Always set **Auto Termination** (e.g., 10-20 mins) to ensure VMs are deleted when not in use."
