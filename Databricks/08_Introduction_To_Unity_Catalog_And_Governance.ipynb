    "# Introduction to Unity Catalog & Data Governance\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** Understand the concept of \"Unified Governance\" in Databricks using Unity Catalog. We will learn about the object hierarchy (Metastore, Catalog, Schema, Table) and the importance of the 3-level namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. What is Data Governance?\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Governance ensures your data is:\n",
    "1.  **Secure:** Only authorized users can access it.\n",
    "2.  **Available:** Users can find the data they need (Discovery).\n",
    "3.  **Accurate:** You know where the data came from (Lineage) and who changed it (Audit).\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Problem \"Without\" Unity Catalog\n",
    "*   Governance was tied to a specific **Workspace**.\n",
    "*   If you had a `Dev` workspace and a `Prod` workspace, you had to define users and permissions twice.\n",
    "*   Data was siloed within workspaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Solution \"With\" Unity Catalog\n",
    "*   **Unified Governance:** Define permissions once at the Account level, and they apply across all Workspaces attached to the Metastore.\n",
    "*   **Centralized Metadata:** Metadata lives in the Control Plane, while actual data remains in your Cloud Storage (Data Plane)."

    "| **0** | **Metastore** | The top-level container for metadata. Usually created **one per region** (e.g., East US). |\n",
    "| **1** | **Catalog** | The first level of data grouping. Useful for separating environments (e.g., `dev_catalog`, `prod_catalog`) or business units. |\n",
    "| **2** | **Schema** | (Also called Database). Contains tables, views, and volumes. |\n",

    "*   **Where:** Data is stored in the \"Root Storage Account\" (Managed Storage) configured for the Metastore or Catalog.\n",

    "\n",
    "1.  **Define Once, Secure Everywhere:** Grant access to a group on a Catalog, and they get access in every workspace.\n",
    "2.  **Data Lineage:** Automatically tracks how data flows (e.g., Table A -> Notebook -> Table B).\n",
    "3.  **Data Discovery:** Search for data assets across the entire organization.\n",
    "4.  **Delta Sharing:** Securely share data with external organizations without copying it."
