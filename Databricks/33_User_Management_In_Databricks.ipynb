    "# User Management in Databricks\n",
    "## Users, Groups & Service Principals\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:**\n",
    "In this session, we will learn how to manage access and identities within the Databricks Data Intelligence Platform. We will cover the creation of Users, Groups, and Service Principals, and understand the hierarchy of permissions from the Account level down to the Workspace level.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "1.  **Account Console:** The central management pane for all Databricks workspaces (Unity Catalog level).\n",
    "2.  **Workspace Admin vs. Account Admin:** Different levels of administrative control.\n",
    "3.  **Service Principals:** Non-human \"robot\" accounts used for automation (Jobs, CI/CD).\n",
    "4.  **SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management):** Auto-provisioning users from Identity Providers (like Azure Entra ID).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "To follow along with the administrative steps, you need:\n",
    "*   **Cloud Admin Access** (e.g., Azure Active Directory / Entra ID role to create users).\n",
    "*   **Databricks Account Admin Access**.\n",
    "*   **Workspace Admin Access**."

    "## 1. Creating Users (Azure Entra ID)\n",
    "\n",
    "Databricks on Azure relies on Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) for authentication.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps to create a user:**\n",
    "1.  Navigate to **Azure Portal** -> **Microsoft Entra ID**.\n",
    "2.  Select **Users** -> **New User** -> **Create new user**.\n",
    "3.  **Principal Name:** e.g., `da` (becomes `da@domain.com`).\n",
    "4.  **Display Name:** e.g., `Data Analyst`.\n",
    "5.  **Password:** Create a password (ensure Account is enabled).\n",
    "6.  Click **Review + Create**.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** In a corporate environment, this is usually handled by IT/Admin teams. You would typically sync these users to Databricks automatically using SCIM."

    "\n",
    "Once a user exists in the Cloud Provider (Azure), they need to be added to the Databricks Account.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Manual Method:**\n",
    "1.  Go to **Manage Account** (accounts.azuredatabricks.net).\n",
    "2.  Navigate to **User Management** -> **Users** tab.\n",
    "3.  Click **Add User** and enter the email/UPN (User Principal Name) from Azure.\n",
    "4.  *Role Assignment:* You can make them an **Account Admin** here, but typically for standard users (Analysts/Engineers), you leave roles blank.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Automated Method (SCIM):**\n",
    "*   Go to **Settings** -> **User Provisioning**.\n",
    "*   Configure SCIM to automatically sync users and groups from Entra ID to Databricks.\n",

    "We have a Data Analyst team. Instead of adding `User A`, `User B`, etc., to a workspace one by one:\n",
    "1.  Go to **User Management** -> **Groups**.\n",
    "2.  Create a group: `da_grp` (Data Analyst Group).\n",
    "3.  Add the `Data Analyst` user to this group.\n",
    "4.  In the future, any new analyst just needs to be added to this **Group**, and they inherit all permissions automatically."

    "\n",
    "Adding a user to the Account Console **does not** give them access to a Workspace (e.g., `adb-xxxx`). You must explicitly assign them.\n",
    "\n",

    "1.  In Account Console, go to **Workspaces**.\n",
    "2.  Select your workspace (e.g., `self-adb`).\n",
    "3.  Click **Permissions** -> **Add Permissions**.\n",

    "**Service Principals (SP)** are identities used by software, pipelines, or automated jobs, rather than humans.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why use Service Principals?\n",
    "1.  **Production Stability:** If a human user (e.g., `John Doe`) leaves the company, their account is deleted, and any jobs running as `John Doe` will fail. SPs persist.\n",

    "1.  **Azure Portal** -> **App Registrations** -> **New Registration**.\n",
