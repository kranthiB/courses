    "# Delta Sharing: Secure Data Sharing Across Organizations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Delta Sharing** is an open protocol developed by Databricks for secure data sharing with other organizations regardless of the computing platforms they use. It allows you to share data \"live\" without copying it to another system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features:\n",
    "1.  **Open Protocol:** It is not limited to Databricks. You can share data with users using Power BI, Tableau, Pandas, Apache Spark, or any system that supports the Delta Sharing open protocol.\n",
    "2.  **Live Data:** It shares the data as it exists in your Data Lake. There is no replication or movement of data.\n",
    "3.  **Secure & Governed:** Managed centrally via **Unity Catalog**. You can audit who is accessing what data.\n",
    "4.  **Cross-Cloud:** Share data from AWS to Azure, or Azure to GCP easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Two Modes of Sharing\n",
    "1.  **Databricks-to-Databricks:**\n",
    "    *   Optimized experience.\n",
    "    *   The recipient is another Databricks Workspace (even in a different account/cloud).\n",
    "    *   Authentication is handled automatically via **Sharing Identifiers**.\n",
    "2.  **Open Sharing (Token-Based):**\n",
    "    *   For recipients not using Databricks.\n",
    "    *   Uses a secure token and a credential file (`.share` profile).\n",
    "    *   The recipient uses an open-source client (e.g., Python `delta-sharing` library) to read data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Terminology in Unity Catalog\n",
    "| Object | Description |\n",
    "| :--- | :--- |\n",
    "| **Provider** | The entity sharing the data. In the recipient's workspace, this object represents the source of the data. |\n",
    "| **Recipient** | The entity receiving the data. In the provider's workspace, this object represents who you are sharing with. |\n",
    "| **Share** | A logical container (like a folder) that groups the tables, views, and volumes you want to share. |"

    "To manage Delta Sharing, you typically need **Metastore Admin** privileges or specific delegations:\n",
    "*   `CREATE SHARE`\n",
    "*   `CREATE RECIPIENT`\n",
    "*   `CREATE PROVIDER`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Enable Delta Sharing on Metastore\n",
    "If you are sharing data **outside** your Databricks account (e.g., to an external client or a different organization), you must explicitly enable Delta Sharing at the Metastore level.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps:**\n",
    "1.  Go to **Account Console** -> **Catalog**.\n",
    "2.  Select your Metastore.\n",
    "3.  Check **\"Allow Delta Sharing with parties outside your organization\"**.\n",
    "4.  Set a default token lifetime (optional)."
