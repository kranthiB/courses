    "# Databricks SQL Alerts\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:**\n",
    "Learn how to monitor your data and business metrics using **Databricks SQL Alerts**. We will set up a mechanism to send notifications to specific destinations (like Email, Slack, or Teams) when a specific condition in your data is met.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are SQL Alerts?\n",
    "SQL Alerts allow you to run a SQL query periodically, evaluate the result against a defined condition, and send notifications if that condition is satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Use Cases:**\n",
    "1.  **Infrastructure Monitoring:** Alert if a sensor status is 'DOWN'.\n",
    "2.  **Data Quality:** Alert if `NULL` count in a critical column exceeds a threshold.\n",
    "3.  **Business Logic:** Alert if \"Pending Orders\" count exceeds 10,000 (The use case for today).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "*   You must have access to **Databricks SQL**.\n",
    "*   We will use the `orders_raw` table created in previous sessions (located in `dev.bronze`).\n",
    "*   **Note:** Creating \"Destinations\" requires **Workspace Admin** privileges."

    "1.  **Navigate to Alerts:** Click on **Alerts** in the left sidebar of the Databricks SQL persona.\n",
    "2.  **Create Alert:** Click the **Create Alert** button.\n",

    "4.  **Define Trigger Condition:**\n",
    "    *   **Value Column:** `pending_orders_count` (the output column of our query).\n",
    "    *   **Operator:** `>` (Greater than).\n",
    "    *   **Threshold Value:** `10000`.\n",
    "    *   *Logic:* If `pending_orders_count > 10000`, the alert status becomes `TRIGGERED`.\n",
    "5.  **Empty Results:** Set \"When query result has no rows\" to **OK** (implies 0 pending orders)."
