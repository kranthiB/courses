    "# Unity Catalog Metric Views - Building a Semantic Model\n",
    "\n",
    "**Metric Views** in Unity Catalog provide a centralized way to define and manage consistent, reusable, and governed core business metrics. They act as a **Semantic Layer** on top of your data tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why use Metric Views?**\n",
    "1.  **Abstraction:** Hides complex SQL logic (Joins, Window functions, Aggregations) from end-users.\n",
    "2.  **Consistency:** Defines a \"Single Source of Truth\". Everyone calculates \"Profit\" or \"Total Orders\" the exact same way.\n",
    "3.  **Reusability:** Defined once, used everywhere (SQL queries, Dashboards, BI Tools).\n",
    "4.  **Governance:** You can control permissions on who can access specific metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In this notebook, we will:**\n",
    "1.  Understand the structure of a Metric View (YAML).\n",
    "2.  Define Dimensions and Measures.\n",
    "3.  Implement complex logic like **Year-over-Year (YoY) Growth** using Window functions.\n",
    "4.  Join Fact and Dimension tables within the view.\n",
    "5.  Query the Metric View using the special `MEASURE()` syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "*   A Unity Catalog enabled Workspace.\n",
    "*   The `orders_raw` and `customer` tables in your catalog/schema (created in previous sessions)."

    "1.  **Code Reduction:** The SQL query in Cell 12 is incredibly simple. To write that in raw SQL, you would need:\n",

    "    *   `CASE WHEN` logic for null handling.\n",
    "    *   `DATE_TRUNC` logic.\n",
    "    *   Window functions (`LAG`) for previous year calculation.\n",
    "    *   Group By clauses.\n",
    "2.  **Self-Service:** Business analysts can use these metrics in PowerBI or Tableau without needing to know the underlying complex SQL.\n",
    "3.  **Agility:** If the logic for \"Total Orders\" changes, you update the Metric View YAML once, and all reports update automatically."
