    "**Objective:**\n",
    "In this session, we explore **Databricks AI/BI Genie**, a tool that allows business users to interact with data using natural language (text prompts). Unlike standard dashboards, Genie allows for ad-hoc exploration without writing SQL.\n",

    "**What we will cover:**\n",
    "1.  Understanding Genie Spaces.\n",
    "2.  **Metadata Enrichment:** Preparing data descriptions for the AI.\n",
    "3.  Creating and Configuring a Genie Space.\n",
    "4.  Adding **Instructions** and **Trusted Assets**.\n",
    "5.  Testing with Natural Language Queries.\n",
    "6.  Managing Permissions for Business Users.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pre-requisites:**\n",
    "*   Tables `orders_raw` and `customer_raw` in your Unity Catalog (created in previous sessions).\n",
