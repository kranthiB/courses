    "# Databricks Git Integration (Git Folders)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:**\n",
    "In this session, we will learn how to integrate Git repositories with the Azure Databricks workspace using **Databricks Git Folders** (formerly known as Repos). This is the starting point for implementing CI/CD pipelines for your data engineering workloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we will cover:**\n",
    "1.  Setting up an **Azure DevOps** Project and Repository.\n",
    "2.  Configuring Git Credentials in Databricks.\n",
    "3.  Cloning a remote repository into Databricks.\n",
    "4.  Performing Git operations (Branching, Commit, Push).\n",
    "5.  Best practices for storing notebooks (Source format vs. IPYNB).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prerequisites:**\n",
    "*   Basic knowledge of Git concepts (Clone, Commit, Push, Branch).\n",
    "*   An Azure DevOps account (or GitHub/GitLab)."

    "Before working in Databricks, we need a remote repository to store our code.\n",

    "1.  **Log in to Azure DevOps:**\n",
    "    *   Go to [dev.azure.com](https://dev.azure.com).\n",
    "    *   If you don't have an organization, create one.\n",

    "    *   Click your **Profile Icon** (top right) -> **Settings**.\n",
    "    *   Go to **Linked Accounts**.\n",
    "    *   Under **Git Integration**, click **\"Add Git Credential\"**.\n",
    "    *   **Provider:** Azure DevOps Services (Personal Access Token).\n",
    "    *   **Username:** Your email or the username generated in the previous step.\n",

    "3.  **File Format Best Practice:**\n",
    "    *   By default, notebooks might save as `.ipynb` (standard Jupyter).\n",
    "    *   **Recommended:** Go to **File** -> **Export** or verify settings to save as **Source** (e.g., `.py` for Python).\n",
