    "# Databricks Asset Bundles (DABs) - Part 2\n",
    "## CI/CD with Azure DevOps\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous session, we configured a DAB project and deployed it to a **Dev** environment using the CLI and UI.\n",
    "In this session, we will automate the deployment to a **QA (Quality Assurance)** environment using **Azure DevOps Pipelines**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "1.  Setup permissions for Service Principals in Databricks.\n",
    "2.  Configure **Azure DevOps Variable Groups** for secure credential management.\n",
    "3.  Write an **Azure Pipeline YAML** (`azure-pipelines.yml`) for DAB deployment.\n",
    "4.  Understand how to parameterize pipelines for different environments.\n",
    "5.  Deploy the bundle to a QA workspace using the Service Principal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "*   A **QA Databricks Workspace** (separate from Dev).\n",
    "*   An **Azure Service Principal (SP)** created and added to the Databricks Account.\n",
    "*   **Azure DevOps Project** connected to your Git repository.\n",
    "*   **Parallel Jobs** (Free Tier or Paid) enabled in Azure DevOps to run pipelines."

    "Before automating deployment, we need to ensure the Service Principal (SP) has the right access. We do not deploy to QA/Prod using user credentials; we use a Service Principal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Workspace Access\n",
    "1.  Go to **Databricks Account Console** -> **Workspaces** -> Select **QA Workspace**.\n",
    "2.  Go to **Permissions** -> **Add permissions**.\n",
    "3.  Search for your **Service Principal** (e.g., `azure-sp`).\n",
    "4.  Grant **Admin** role (required to create jobs/pipelines/schemas).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Catalog Permissions\n",
    "1.  Log in to the **QA Workspace**.\n",
    "2.  Go to **Catalog Explorer**.\n",
    "3.  Select the target catalog (e.g., `qa`).\n",
    "4.  Click **Permissions** -> **Grant**.\n",
    "5.  Grant **ALL PRIVILEGES** to the Service Principal. This allows the SP to create the `bronze` schema defined in our bundle."

    "\n",
    "1.  Go to **Azure DevOps** -> **Pipelines** -> **Library**.\n",
    "2.  Click **+ Variable group**.\n",
    "3.  Name it: `qa_variables` (Naming convention is important for dynamic referencing).\n",
