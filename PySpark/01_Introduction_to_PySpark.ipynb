    "## Module 1: Introduction to Apache Spark\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the \"PySpark Zero to Hero\" course. In this series, we will move from the absolute basics of Spark to advanced production-level scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why this Course?\n",
    "Before writing our first line of code, it is essential to understand why PySpark is a critical skill in the modern data landscape:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Industry Demand:** Spark is the de-facto standard for big data processing, widely used by Data Engineers, Analysts, and Scientists.\n",
    "2.  **Beyond Syntax:** With the rise of Generative AI, writing code has become easier. However, the real value lies in understanding **architecture**—knowing *how* distributed computing works and *why* we choose specific optimization strategies.\n",
    "3.  **Production Focus:** This course focuses not just on \"hello world\" examples, but on the tips and tricks required for real-world production environments."

    "## What is Apache Spark?\n",
    "\n",
    "Apache Spark is an open-source **Unified Computing Engine** designed for fast, parallel data processing on computer clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Capabilities\n",
    "*   **Unified Engine:** It acts as a \"one-stop-shop\" for big data, supporting SQL, Streaming, Machine Learning (MLlib), and Graph processing within a single framework.\n",
    "*   **Multi-Language:** While written in Scala, Spark provides robust APIs for Python (PySpark), Java, and R.\n",
    "*   **Distributed Processing:** Spark splits data into chunks and processes them in parallel across multiple nodes (computers)."

    "1.  **Libraries & Ecosystem (Top Layer):**\n",
    "    *   This includes high-level tools like **Structured Streaming**, **MLlib**, and **GraphX**.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2.  **Structured APIs (Middle Layer):**\n",
    "    *   This is where we will spend 90% of our time.\n",
    "    *   Includes **DataFrames**, **Datasets**, and **Spark SQL**.\n",
    "    *   These APIs are optimized to run efficiently regardless of the language (Python/Scala) used.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Low-Level APIs (Foundation):**\n",
    "    *   **RDDs (Resilient Distributed Datasets)** & Distributed Variables.\n",
    "    *   This is the assembly language of Spark. Even when we use DataFrames, Spark compiles them down to RDDs for execution."
