    "\n",
    "A DataFrame is the most common Structured API in Spark.\n",
    "*   **Structure:** It looks exactly like a Table in a database or Excel. It has **Rows** and **Columns**.\n",
    "*   **Schema:** It has a defined schema (column names and data types).\n",
    "*   **Distributed:** Unlike a Pandas DataFrame (which sits on one computer), a Spark DataFrame is split into **Partitions** and spread across the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** DataFrames are built on top of RDDs. They are easier to use and much faster due to the optimization engine."

    "\n",
    "DataFrames are **Immutable**. This means once you create a DataFrame, **you cannot change it**.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Scenario:** You have `df1` and you want to filter it.\n",
    "*   **Action:** Spark does *not* modify `df1`. Instead, it creates a new DataFrame `df2` that contains the filtered results.\n",
    "*   **Why?** This is crucial for fault tolerance in distributed computing. If a node crashes, Spark knows exactly how to recreate the data from the original immutable source."

    "## 3. How Spark Compiles Code: The Execution Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "When you write `df.select().filter()`, Spark does not run it immediately. It goes through four distinct phases to optimize your code. This process is handled by the **Catalyst Optimizer**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 1: Unresolved Logical Plan\n",
    "*   Spark checks your syntax.\n",
    "*   It knows you want to query a table named \"Sales\", but it doesn't know if that table actually exists or if the columns are correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 2: Resolved Logical Plan\n",
    "*   Spark looks up the **Catalog** (metadata repository).\n",
    "*   It verifies: *\"Does the 'Sales' table exist? Does column 'Amount' exist?\"*\n",
    "*   If yes, the plan is \"Resolved\". If no, it throws an AnalysisException.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 3: Optimized Logical Plan\n",
    "*   The Catalyst Optimizer applies rules to make queries faster.\n",
    "*   *Example:* If you `filter` data and then `select` a column, Spark will swap them to `filter` first (Predicate Pushdown) to reduce the data volume as early as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 4: Physical Plan\n",
    "*   Spark generates multiple physical plans (different ways to actually do the job on the hardware).\n",
    "*   **Cost Model:** It calculates the \"cost\" (CPU/RAM usage) of each plan.\n",
    "*   It selects the **Best Physical Plan** and sends it to the Executors."
